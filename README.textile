h1. accessifyhtml5.js

This should probably go into modernizr or something, so see it just as a prototype. It depends on jQuery and was quickly hacked together. Please suggest improvements to @yatil.

It adds ARIA to new elements in browsers which donâ€™t do it by themselves.

Just drop into the bottom of your web page:
<script src="accessifyhtml5.js"></script>

Todo: Extend Script for other elements, probably even play with fallback JS for inaccessible audio/video.

h2. Known Issues:

According to @jkiss, Window-Eyes 7.11 struggles with aria-roles and HTML5, this is nothing I can solve with this script but is a screen reader issue. See: http://ya.tl/aNH1YQ
